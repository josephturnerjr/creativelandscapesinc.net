The new owner of this home moved into the Blackmoor Golf Community of
Murrells Inlet, SC with outdoor living in mind. A green egg, gas grill,
charcoal grill, dining table with six chairs, chaise lounge chairs, a
Pawleys Island Rope Hammock and more would require some thoughtful
design to properly develop the space in this smaller, sloping back yard.

The existing patio was too small to accommodate the dining table and
chairs and various grills; so, foundation plants were removed and the
concrete expanded to an adequate size. Finally, the concrete was dressed
with a Belgard paver overlay. Adjoining the large patio one step down a
couple of chairs create a comfortable reading nook. The chaise loungers
and hammock located a bit away from the main patio occupy a niche
designed for relaxation.
