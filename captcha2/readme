Installation:
	1 - Upload the files into a folder on your website.
	2 - Run the system_check.php for possible incompatibility
	3 - Place the captcha into your form, like this:
		<img src="http://www.your-web-site-url.com/captcha/captcha.php" />
		Then put a form field in front of the image like:
		<input type="text" name="CAPTCHA" />
		
	4 - The captcha code is automatically written into a session variable called
		$_SESSION['CAPTCHA'], you have to check it against the user input
		like this:
		if($_SESSION['CAPTCHA'] != $_POST['CAPTCHA']) {
			echo 'You entered the wrong code!';
			// give him an option to go back and fix it!
		} else {
			// He is not a robot so process your form here
		}

Note: In <input type="text" name="CAPTCHA" />, CAPTCHA is case sensitive that is
if you use <input type="text" name="captcha" />, then you will have to check user
input like this: if($_SESSION['CAPTCHA'] != $_POST['captcha']) ...

Good Luck!
