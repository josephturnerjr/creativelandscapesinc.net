                  <h4>FAQ</h4>
                  <hr color="#3e6534" size="1">
                  <h5><img src="images/faq_pic.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="117" hspace="5" width="175">Is there a time of year that is better for planting?</h5>
                  <p>In
our climate and thanks to container grown plant material. we are able
to plant&nbsp;all year long as long as there is a source for watering
the plantings. If you want to know the ideal time for planting I would
say it is during the dormant season. For renovations it is best to work
in the dormant season because plants transplant better when dormant.
Also, some large trees cannot be moved when actively growing. For some
projects destined for summer plantings we will have the large material
dug in the spring and hold it under irrigation until the project is
ready for trees.</p>
                  <h5>Do you grow your own plants?</h5>
                  <p>We
are not growers. We buy our plant material from wholesale growers all
over the Southeast. Plants are ordered on a per job basis so the plants
are in top condition from the grower when the come to us.</p>
                  <h5><img src="images/meeting_pic.jpg" alt="Preliminary plans are produced and the client is called to review the drawing and to approve or choose direction." align="right" border="1" height="119" hspace="5" width="175">What if I don't like the design when you've finished it?</h5>
                  <p>The
most important part of the design process is the interview. It is the
job of the landscape designer to develop an understanding of the client
and the relationship of the client to the property. How the property is
used and viewed by the client will come out in the interview. The likes
and dislikes of the client down to individual plants will be discussed
and noted. The preliminary plan is reviewed before final draft. I have
had clients change some things more to their liking on the final plan
but the changes are minor. The basic design will be a reflection of the
owners taste, the architecture of the building, and the beauty of
existing features on the property.</p>
                  <h5>Do I really need an automatic irrigation system ?</h5>
                  <p>Some
small residential properties, one half acre or less. can get by without
an automatic sprinkler system if the owner is a diligent gardener; but,
99 percent of the time, we install an automatic system. The difference
in the growth and health of the plantings makes it well worth the cost
to install a system. The cost of the system figured over the life of
the system makes it a real value.</p>
                  <h5>How often should I water?</h5>
                  <p>An established garden should be watered deeply twice weekly. In
                  cases of severe drought you may have to go to three times a week. Our general instructions for plantings
                  established 2 months or longer in fairly well drained soil during the growth season is:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Zones with pop ups set for 30 minutes and zones with rotors for 45 minutes.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>During wet, cool season once a week is adequate.</p>
                  <p>Watering to establish newly installed plants is different.
                  New plantings, particularly lawns, need to be watered every
                  day until the roots begin to grow down. Generally it's every
                  day for two weeks, then wean it back to every other day for a
                  week or two. After that you go to three times a week for a
                  week or two. Then you treat it as established as explained in the first paragraph.</p>
                  <p><b>An important reminder:</b> There is a great deal of variation in soil types and drainage availability on sites. A project should
                  be carefully monitored when setting a watering pattern. Excessive wetness is a serious problem in any garden.</p>
                  <h5>Do you do maintenance?</h5>
                  <p>No, we do not perform routine maintenance on any properties. We are specialized in design, installation, and
                  renovation. We do give clear instructions on how to maintain a
                  property upon completion of the project and can suggest some companies to call for maintenance quotes.</p>
                  <h5>Can you just spruce this property up without a plan?</h5>
                  <p>We rarely do a project without a plan. Even a property that
                  seems only to need refurbishing will be greatly enhanced if
                  carefully considered under the creative eye of a good
                  landscape designer. Again the money spent on having a plan
                  drawn is well worth the cost. A property designed by a person
                  who understands how the plantings will look after years of
                  growth will always stand out above the others.</p>
                  <h5>Does the landscape design fee that I pay you go toward the installation
                  of my work?</h5>
                  <p>No, the design of a project and the installation of a project
                  are two separate processes. Both take time and materials. Both
                  require specialized training. Both are well worth the price we charge for them.</p></td>
