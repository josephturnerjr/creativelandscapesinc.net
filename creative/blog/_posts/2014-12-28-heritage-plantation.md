title: Paver Patio with Firepit in Pawleys Island
author: Sharon Turner

This landscaping project in Heritage Plantation located in Pawleys
Island, SC creates a beautiful outdoor living space from a sloping,
difficult to use lawn area. The owners purchased a large fire pit and
wanted to have a patio at ground level so they can enjoy outside
entertaining. There was an existing concrete space at the bottom of
their elevated patio but that area was too small for any practical use.

A new larger patio of interlocking concrete pavers became the seating
area around the fire pit and a matching concrete retaining wall helped
level the area and integrate the new patio and plantings into the
enlarged existing concrete seating area.

Additionally, the new patio is centered on the large window view from
the main living space inside the home. The beautiful views of the golf
course are enhanced with plants just tall enough to provide color,
framing, and screening as needed.
