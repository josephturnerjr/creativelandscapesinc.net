This appearance of this older home located in the Blackmoor Golf
community of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina  suffered from poor
placement and overgrown shrubs in the front of the home.

The older plants were removed and the bed lines changed to work with the
existing slope and enhance the curb appeal. Mature shrubs were installed
along the foundation and the beds were elevated to create a seasoned
look yet minimize maintenance.

The congested entrance is redesigned to be welcoming to the home owner
and their guests. Stay tuned for the next blog post to see landscape
improvements to other areas around this home including creative concrete
interlocking paver use in the back.
