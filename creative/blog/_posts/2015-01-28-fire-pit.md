The new owners of this home in the Blackmoor Community of Murrells
Inlet, SC wanted to better develop the gracious space in their side
yard. When they moved in the shrubs were poorly maintained and the bed
lines undefined. The garage side door needed a surfaced access to the
driveway.  A lovely Live Oak in the back offered the opportunity for
outdoor living but the area was congested with remnants of failed DIY
projects.

A concrete walk added from the side door to the garage improved the
function of  side access into the garage. Sustainable plantings were
added to the foundation and the bed lines sharpened. A patio of Belgard
interlocking concrete tiles over concrete serves as a base for the fire
pit/table and chairs with a walk leading into the cozy luxury of the
back yard. 
Stay tuned; the back yard of this home will be featured in an upcoming
blog post.
