  Design and bid work for installations includes garden restoration and renovations for commercial as well as residential properties. Turn key installation can include grading, drainage, irrigation, fencing, and lighting as well as any required plantings. Driveway and walkways can also be designed.

  The Southern garden can provide beautiful color in every season. Color and fragrance are traditional elements in a southern garden. Because there is so much color and texture in the Southern garden, the garden often becomes a source for flowers and foliage both useful in the home in floral arrangements, and as a home for our beautiful birds and butterflies.

  Proper and efficient installation is important on any site. We are well equipped for the tasks we take on; so the work can be accomplished in a timely manner and will become established and continue to grow in beauty over the years. All work is guaranteed for a year. We are diligent in assuring that the plantings receive proper care; so training the owner to understand the plant's needs is part of our turn key price. We don't do maintenance ourselves but do impart verbally and in writing what is required.
  Any design work generated from this office is created by trained landscape designers. We also have a trained designer in the field in case some last minute changes occur (and they usually do).

  Bid work is a large part of work generated in this office. We are interested in bidding work from Wilmington, NC to Charleston, SC and inland to Florence. The bulk of our work is performed in the counties of Horry and Georgetown. We would travel to perform work ranging from $25,000 and up.
